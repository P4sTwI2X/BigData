1. Introduction	
- Imagen is a text-to-image developed by google, it can help people express their artistic self without having to learn how to draw. 
- Note: Since I can’t find anything about Imagen, I’ll be talking about Imagen 2 instead which is available in Gemini.
- Motivations: delivering high-quality, photorealistic images that are closely aligned and consistent with the user’s prompt, generate more lifelike images by using the natural distribution of its training data, instead of adopting a pre-programmed style.
- Imagen evolution:
  + Early stage: Research about AI, and algorithm to generate image
  + Development stage: Feed data to AI to learn
  + Beta stage: Google launched the Trusted Tester Program, granting access for limited users.
  + Release stage: Imagen 2 was released on December 13, 2023 and is available in Gemini (google bard AI).
2. A deeper insight to the selected solution
2.1. Major components and main functionalities: 
- Major components in Imagen: 
  + Text Encoder (Transformer encoder): This component will convert the user input (text) into a numerical representation that encapsulates the semantic information within the text.
  + Image-generator: This component will generate an image using the information got from the encoder using diffusion model.+ 
  + Super-Resolution model: This component will scale up the image obtained from the image-generator while maintaining high resolution.
- Main functionalities:
  + Text to image: Generate image from text prompt
  + Image editing: Edit image or part of image using text prompt
  + Visual caption: Generate captions from images, getting informative text responses to questions about image details.
2.2. Its applications in academic and/or industry activities
- In academic activities: 
  + Scientific illustrations: Professors or students can use this AI to generate images of certain things to help them understand the topic clearer.
  + Data visualization: Researchers can use Imagen to generate visualization from their data for further research.
- In industry activities:
  + Logo design: The AI can be used to generate realistic logos that suit their needs.
Advertising: Combine the text to image and visual caption, companies can quickly create a design for their advertisement.
2.3. Its popularity (i.e., how many users choose this solution)
I can’t find any information about its popularity. However, I’m certain that many companies are using it right now.
2.4. Identify other solutions that have similar functionalities and compare them on different aspects:
- Imagen strength: 
  + High-quality photo: Imagen can generate high-resolution images 
  + Advanced painting and editing: Imagen allows you to edit only parts of an uploaded or generated image using a mask area you define.
- Imagen weakness: 
  + Limited access: although Imagen 2 is available in Gemini, but it is a free version and is not as strong as the paid version
  + Limited style: User have less control over style compared to Midjourney
