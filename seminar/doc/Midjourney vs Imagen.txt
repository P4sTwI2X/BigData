Description:

Midjourney: excels at generating realistic and visually captivating images for futuristic designs.
Imagen: the images provided as test outputs demonstrate its impressive precision in generating realistic images with text. Additionally, Image by Google allows users to modify parts of the generated images using text prompts, adding a new level of editing capabilities. Once available, it has the potential to revolutionize the image generation landscape.

Test results:

- Case test: PowerPoint slide. (Imagen)

Midjourney: The images appeared distorted, and the text overlay was not rendered correctly. This is due to the current limitations of the AI model in properly generating text on the images.
Imagen: the test outputs provided by Google showcase its potential in generating images with precise text overlays.

- Case test: Futuristic design. (both, slightly on Mid)

Midjourney: Mid Journey excelled in this task, producing visually stunning and futuristic images. The generated images captured the essence of a futuristic design and displayed intricate details. Mid Journey may not always capture all the points of the prompt.
Imagen: The test outputs provided by Google showcased its ability to create images with precise details and minimal distortion.

- Case test: Adding text to an image. (Mid)

Midjourney: The images generated by Mid Journey showcased the requested text, and the overall aesthetics were impressive. However, the text was not accurate, which is a known limitation of the tool. Mid Journey is more suitable for visual exploration and brainstorming rather than achieving specific text-based designs.
Image by Google is expected to excel in generating images with accurate text overlays. The ability to modify parts of the image based on textual prompts opens up new possibilities for customization and editing.

- Tool comparison:

Mid Journey shines when it comes to generating futuristic art and is highly regarded among professionals in the game development industry. It produces visually captivating images with intricate details, although the accuracy of text generation may be compromised.
Image by Google shows great promise, with impressive precision in generating images and adding/editing text overlays. Although not widely available yet, it has the potential to revolutionize the image generation landscape once released.
